# pokeDex

A Pokemon Index App.

An app that displays 718 pokemon in a collectionView. Tapping on an image desplays more details about that Pokemon. 
The pokemon were parsed from a CSV File and the data was pulled from the Pokemon API.
* This was built using an MVC framework, this allows other developers to easily see different parts of the app that they may wish to work on.
